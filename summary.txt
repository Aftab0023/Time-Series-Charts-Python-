Sales Analysis Summary

This project analyzes a sales dataset downloaded from Kaggle. 
The dataset contains transaction-level sales data recorded across different product
categories throughout the year 2023.

Key Observations:

• Sales are distributed across four major product categories: Clothing, Electronics,
  Furniture, and Food.
• Clothing recorded the highest overall sales contribution.
• Furniture and Electronics showed strong and consistent performance.
• Food category contributed the smallest share but remained stable over time.

Time Series Analysis:

• Daily sales data shows high variability, indicating frequent fluctuations
  in transaction volume.
• Monthly aggregation reveals stable sales patterns with moderate ups and downs.
• Quarterly analysis highlights consistent performance across most quarters.
• A drop in the final month/quarter is observed due to limited data availability
  for the period.

Visualization Summary:

• Line charts were used to represent sales trends over time.
• Monthly and quarterly aggregations helped identify broader sales patterns.
• Bar charts were used to compare total sales across product categories.
• Pie charts were used to visualize category-wise sales contribution.

This analysis demonstrates effective use of time-series and categorical
visualizations for sales data exploration.
