## 📌 Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of sales performance for the year 2023. By leveraging **Time-Series analysis** and **Categorical data visualization**, the project transforms raw Kaggle transaction data into actionable business insights.

The analysis focuses on identifying seasonal trends, high-performing product categories, and overall revenue distribution.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
* **Trend Analysis:** Map daily, monthly, and quarterly sales fluctuations.
* **Categorical Comparison:** Evaluate performance across different product lines.
* **Market Share Visualization:** Determine the percentage contribution of each category to total revenue.
* **Automated Reporting:** Export all visualizations as high-resolution PNGs and generate a text-based summary.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
* **Python:** Core programming logic.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** Interactive environment for data exploration and visualization.
* **Pandas:** Data cleaning, date parsing, and complex aggregations.
* **Matplotlib:** Creation of static, high-quality visualizations.

---

## 📂 Dataset Information
* **Source:** Kaggle (Sales Transactions Dataset)
* **Timeframe:** January 2023 – December 2023
* **Key Features:**
    * `Sale_Date`: Temporal data used for time-series indexing.
    * `Product_Category`: Grouping variable for comparative analysis.
    * `Sales_Amount`: Numerical target for aggregation.

## 📈 Visualizations & Insights
The analysis produces five key visual assets:

| Visualization | Purpose | Key Insight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sales Over Time** | Daily Volatility | Highlights day-to-day transaction peaks. |
| **Monthly Trend** | Seasonal Patterns | Shows stable performance throughout 2023. |
| **Quarterly Trend** | Long-term Growth | Provides a high-level view of fiscal health. |
| **Category Bar Chart** | Volume Comparison | **Clothing** identified as the lead revenue driver. |
| **Category Pie Chart** | Market Share | Visualizes the balanced distribution of sales. |

> **Note:** A slight dip in the final period is observed due to partial data availability for the year-end.
